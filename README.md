## 2. How can I buy CERB?

1. **Early Access Buy Contract**: You have the option to purchase CERB tokens through a buy contract, where a fixed amount of tokens is available at an early access price of **0.06 USD per token**.

2. **Directly from the Market**: CERB tokens will also be available for trading on decentralized exchanges, such as **PancakeSwap**, from day one. This allows you to buy and sell CERB directly on the open market at any time.

## 3. What are the staking options?

You can stake your tokens to generate passive income. The staking yield is **0.27% per day**, providing you with a steady income stream while contributing to the overall security of the network.

---

## 4. Are there fees for staking?

Yes, there is a one-time staking fee of **5,0%**. This fee ensures that the platform remains sustainable while allowing you to enjoy consistent rewards from staking.

---

## 5. How is the capital used?

The capital you invest in Cerebrix AI is allocated as follows:
- **25%** goes into the liquidity pool (LP) to provide stability and facilitate trading.
- **75%** is used for AI-driven trading to maximize returns, enabling the platform to continuously buy back tokens and refill staking pools.

---

## 6. Is there an affiliate program?

Yes, with our affiliate program, you will receive **0.03% daily** from the staking earnings of your downline. These rewards are distributed to your wallet at the moment your downline members claim their staking rewards. The more members you recruit, the higher your potential daily earnings.

---

## 7. How secure are the smart contracts?

Cerebrix AI uses fully audited smart contracts to ensure the highest level of security for your funds. Our contracts have been thoroughly tested by independent third-party auditors to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. The audit reports are publicly available for review to provide full transparency.

For more details, you can view our audit reports [here](#).

## 8. How many tokens are available for staking?

A total of **449,970,000 CERB tokens** are available for staking from the start. Additionally, with the profits generated from the **75%** of capital allocated to AI-driven trading, we will constantly buy back CERB tokens from the market and refill the staking contract. This ensures the continuous availability of tokens for staking and supports long-term rewards for participants.

---

## 9. How does AI-driven trading generate profits?

Our AI algorithms analyze real-time market data, identify trends, and execute trades with high efficiency and accuracy. **75%** of the capital is allocated to these AI-driven trades, and profits generated are used to:
1.	Burned: Tokens are burned to reduce the circulating supply, increasing scarcity and potentially enhancing the value of existing tokens.
2.	Added to Liquidity Pools: Tokens are added to liquidity pools, improving market stability and facilitating smoother trading on decentralized exchanges.
3.	Deposited into the Staking Contract: Tokens are deposited back into the staking contract to maintain liquidity and ensure the continued distribution of staking rewards for CERB holders.
   
This flexible buyback mechanism is designed to support both token value and the long-term sustainability of the staking program, providing ongoing benefits to the community.

## 10. Is there any insurance or protection for my funds?

While DeFi investments carry inherent risks, we have implemented several safety measures such as smart contract audits and stringent security protocols. However, **there is no insurance or guarantee** for your funds. It's important to note that **you hold your CERB tokens in your own wallet**, and you are responsible for the safety of your assets.

The only guarantee we can provide is that, as long as the staking contract holds CERB tokens, they will be distributed at a fixed rate of **0.27% per day**.

Please be aware that **at no time will any member of the Cerebrix AI team ask for your funds or private keys**. All transactions are conducted exclusively through secure smart contracts, ensuring that you remain in control of your assets at all times.

We encourage users to take precautions to ensure the security of their wallet and private keys, and to invest only what they can afford to lose, as DeFi investments are subject to market volatility.
